# New API features

New API features must be documented where appropriate, this document aims to cover everywhere you need to update for new features.

Before writing new API features, generally a good idea to:

- Consult with other developers in the [Revolt Developers space](https://rvlt.gg/API)
- If it's a relatively big feature, also [write an RFC](https://github.com/revoltchat/rfcs)

When your feature is ready to release, ensure to:

- Update backend documentation (what you're reading now!) if applicable
- Update the [developers documentation](https://github.com/revoltchat/wiki) if applicable
- Update the Feature Matrix (or ask someone that can to do so)
- Ensure it is properly listed in the backend release changelog
