## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust 1.76 or higher.

## Development Guide

Before contributing, make yourself familiar with [our contribution guidelines](https://developers.revolt.chat/contrib.html) and the [technical documentation for this project](https://revoltchat.github.io/backend/).

Before getting started, you'll want to install:

- Rust toolchain (rustup recommended)
- Docker
- Git
- mold (optional, faster compilation)

> A **default.nix** is available for Nix users!
> Just run `nix-shell` and continue.

> Windows users must perform the steps below within **Git Bash** and not Powershell or Command Prompt. Otherwise, you will likely encounter build errors because Windows does not recognize Linux commands like 'cp'.

Now you can clone and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/revoltchat/backend revolt-backend
cd revolt-backend
cargo build
```

If you want to run the API and event servers:

```bash
# create environment file (will be deprecated in future)
cp .env.example .env

# (optionally) copy the default configuration file
cp crates/core/config/Revolt.toml Revolt.toml
# configure as necessary...
```

You may want to copy the following configuration:

```toml
# Revolt.toml
[database]
mongodb = "mongodb://localhost"
redis = "redis://localhost"

[hosts]
app = "http://local.revolt.chat"
api = "http://local.revolt.chat:8000"
events = "ws://local.revolt.chat:9000"
autumn = "http://local.revolt.chat:3000"
january = "http://local.revolt.chat:7000"
voso_legacy = ""
voso_legacy_ws = ""
```

Then continue:

```bash
# start other necessary services
docker compose up -d

# run the API server
cargo run --bin revolt-delta
# run the events server
cargo run --bin revolt-bonfire

# hint:
# mold -run <cargo build, cargo run, etc...>
```

You can start a web client by doing the following:

```bash
# if you do not have yarn yet and have a modern Node.js:
corepack enable

# clone the web client and run it:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/revoltchat/revite
cd revite
yarn
yarn build:deps
yarn dev --port 3001
```

Then go to https://local.revolt.chat:3001

## Deployment Guide

### Cutting new crate releases

Begin by bumping crate versions:

```bash
just patch # 0.0.X
just minor # 0.X.0
just major # X.0.0
```

Then commit the changes to package files.

Proceed to publish all the new crates:

```bash
just publish
```

### Cutting new binary releases

Tag and push a new release by running:

```bash
just release
```

If you have bumped the crate versions, proceed to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/revoltchat/backend/releases/new) to create a changelog.

## Testing

First, start the required services:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up -d
```

Now run tests for whichever database:

```sh
TEST_DB=REFERENCE cargo nextest run
TEST_DB=MONGODB cargo nextest run
```
