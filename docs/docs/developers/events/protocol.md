# Events

This page documents various incoming and outgoing events.

**Help Wanted:** we should adopt [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com) to properly document the protocol!

## Client to Server

### Authenticate

Authenticate with the server.

```json
{
  "type": "Authenticate",
  "token": "{token}"
}
```

### BeginTyping

Tell other users that you have begun typing in a channel.

Must be in the specified channel or nothing will happen.

```json
{
  "type": "BeginTyping",
  "channel": "{channel_id}"
}
```

### EndTyping

Tell other users that you have stopped typing in a channel.

Must be in the specified channel or nothing will happen.

```json
{
  "type": "EndTyping",
  "channel": "{channel_id}"
}
```

### Ping

Ping the server, you can specify a timestamp that you'll receive back.

```json
{
  "type": "Ping",
  "data": 0
}
```

### Subscribe

Subscribe to a server's UserUpdate events.

```json
{
  "type": "Subscribe",
  "server_id": "{server_id}"
}
```

Implementation notes:

- Subscriptions automatically expire within 15 minutes.
- A client may have up to 5 active subscriptions.
- This has no effect on bot sessions.
- This event should only be sent **iff** app/client is in focus.
- You should aim to send this event at most every 10 minutes per server.

## Server to Client

An error occurred which meant you couldn't authenticate.

```json

The `{error_id}` can be one of the following:

- `AlreadyAuthenticated`: this connection is already authenticated
